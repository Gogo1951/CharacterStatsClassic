CharacterStatsClassic is an addon for WoW Classic which displays more character stats than the default WoW's interface, inspired by the TBC UI

The addon has two columns with drop downs for different categories of stats:
 - Base Stats
 - Melee
 - Ranged
 - Spell
 - Defenses


Reporting Bugs (How to):

Describe the issue and provide a proof that something is broken. Use https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner to provide reference stats without my addon + an in-game screenshot with my addon so that I can see and compare. I simply cannot test all the classes and all the gear combinations. I've had people false-report "bugs" too many times. Not doing so will lead to me dismissing the bug.
